This project was part of a challenge from Front-End Mentor: https://www.frontendmentor.io/.

## Description:
Have you been feeling down? Feeling lost? Look no further with this advice generator! Every page refresh or by clicking the die will generate a new advice for you. This project uses the Advice Slip API: https://api.adviceslip.com/. 

## Tech Stack

## Next Steps
Since this project was pure Front-End, I'm planning on creating my own advice API and have my Front-End make a call from there instead
